Understanding an .apk + Static Analysis

Reverse engineering

META-INF dir:

	MANIFEST.MF - Enumerates the files that are included in the distribution, either for processing by various packaging tools, or for human use.
	
	CERT.RSA - Certificate of the app.
	
	CERT.SF - List of resources and SHA-1 digest of the corresponding lines in the manifest.MF file
	
lib: Dir contains the compiled code that is specific to a software layer of a processor. The dir is split into more dirs within:
	
	armeabi - compiled code for all ARM based processors only.
	
	armeabi-v7a - compiled code for all ARMv7 and above processors only.
	
	x86 - compiled for x86 processors only.
	
	mips - compiled code for MIPS processors only.
	
res: Dir containing resources not compiled into resources.arsc.

assets: Dir containing application assets

AndroidManifest.xml: Additional Android manifest file, describing the name, version, access rights, referenced library files for the application.

classes.dex: The classes compiled into the DEX file format understandable by the Dalvik virtual machine.

resources.arsc: File containing precompiled resources, such as binary XML for example.

As classes.dex contains code, handle with care. "Dex" stands for Dalvik executable format. As another option, these files can also be collected from the "/data/Dalvik-cache" folder.

check if the website is assigned any unrequired permission. 
Convert .DEX Dalvik format to Java JAR file using dex2jar.
You can also use apk to create .smali files 

Use m0bliz3r for automated sensitive data investigation

NOTE: Better run all the applications in the same folder as your .apk
